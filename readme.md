# Functional AI Agent for Jira Integration

## Overview
This project is a **Functional AI Agent** designed to assist users in building **functional documentations** and seamlessly integrate with **Jira**. Using cutting-edge AI, this agent helps users generate and refine **User Stories** and other functional requirements. Once the User Stories are ready, they can be automatically exported to the desired Jira project.

The application leverages **Python**, **Streamlit** for the user interface, and **LangChain** for managing the AI interactions, ensuring a robust and intuitive experience.
